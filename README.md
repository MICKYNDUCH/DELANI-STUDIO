## Setup.

git clone
extract the file.
cd to the Delani-studio directory.
Open the index.html on your favorite browser.

## Behavior Driven Development
    1. Under what we do, clicking on the image will toggle a paragraph explaining about the service.
    2. Hovering over each image will show a white box with the name of the image.
    3. Upon entering your details and message in the contact-us form, the data will be sent to mail chimp and you will receive a confirmation message thanking you for contacting them.
    4. In case, submit form is entered without any values in the form, an alert message will pop-up telling you to put in valid information.
